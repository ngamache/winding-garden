Here's what left to do as far as the project horizon
* NB: Each task starts with writing the tests to verify the task. 
* Except testing tasks, that's too meta even for me.

- Create optimized relationships between leaves, branches, paths, and users
- Create model methods to create and modify data
- Create integration testing framework for API calls
- Create routing to API
- Create Selenium framework for app testing
- Create reading app
- Create writing app
